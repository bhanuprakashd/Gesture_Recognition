# Gesture_Recognition
Gesture Recognition based on Hand Movements
The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

    1.Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
    2.Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
    3.Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
    4.Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
    5.Stop: Pause the movie

The following are the summary various models used in the training

Cov3D model-2 has good training and validation accuracy but the highest validation accuracy is achieved with CNN_RNN transfer learning

Please find the final model which uses InceptionV3 transfer learning. Due to file size limitation on Github which accpets only 50MB. I am attaching the gdrive link to download the model.
