# Gesture_Recognition
Gesture Recognition based on Hand Movements
The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

    1.Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
    2.Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
    3.Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
    4.Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
    5.Stop: Pause the movie

The best training and validation accuracies of the model are obtained with InceptionV3 Model transfer learning with 0.96

Please find the final model which uses InceptionV3 transfer learning. Due to size limitation on Github which accpets only 50MB. I am attaching the gdrive link to download the model.
